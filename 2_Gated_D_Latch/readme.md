*Breadboard circuit of D Latch (using just 7400 NAND IC)*

The **digital** folder holds the circuit built/simulated using [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) circuit simulator! It is an easy to use digital logic designer and circuit simulator and it includes a large library of 7400 seriec IC chips.

The **quartus** folder holds a schematic developed using Quartus Prime, and includes a waveform simulation.
